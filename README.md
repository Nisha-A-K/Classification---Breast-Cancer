The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [INSERT DATASET SOURCE, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle]. Please ensure you have appropriate permissions to use the dataset.

## Project Objectives

### Data Exploration:

Understanding the distribution of features.

Identifying correlations between attributes.

Visualizing patterns in the data.

### Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Normalizing/Scaling data for uniformity.

Feature selection and engineering.

### Model Development:

Building machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).

Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Insights & Recommendations:
